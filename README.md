# Romanian-Real-Estate-Parser

The script parses information about listings on storia.ro, about apartments for sale, or for rent. It's made for those who would like to work with the data, analyze the listings, further develop the script, but even for those who are simply interested in the real estate prices in Romania.

## Steps of use:

##### 1. Clone the repository
##### 2. Open the script in any text editor or IDE
##### 3. In def main() change the string REGION and TOWN to your desired place. REGION ex. bihor, arad, alba etc.; TOWN ex. oradea, cluj-napoca, iasi etc.
##### 4. Run the script, and wait. Depending on the number of listings it might take from 5 seconds, to 3-4 minutes.
##### 5. Open the .csv file, which you can find in the folder where the script is saved. Open it with excel, notepad, or anything you like.

Feel free to develop the script for your own use, and send pull requests if you wish.
